Education staff was so busy, I feel bored and say, \"I want to talk to you.\" Friend say, \"I'm not so good.\" After school/college walk home feeling tired but ok.\n2. Weekend in the garden with Dad and Mum. Lawn mower was break, I feel bad and say, \"I need some help.\" Dad work it, and we work on flowers again. Garden look clean after that.\n3. At home I head loud music from the kitchen. It make me up, I feel angry and headache. I want to go outside but it is rain, it's gross and wet! I sit down to break feeling confused about what to do. Later, I watch My DVD's favorite film feeling good.","type": "text"}]}]
